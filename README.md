## Task

- Use Ruby on Rails to build a project conversation history. A user should be able to:

## Questions to ask

  - pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled. Pending is the default status.
- What status a project have on creation?
  - Pending
- What happens to the project when a status is changed?
  - The project status is updated to the new status and a confirmation message is displayed.
- Do we need to delete comments?
  - No, we just need add new comments.
- What kind of projects to show on the project index page?
  - Projects with status in_progress only.
- Do I need to show projects with the other statuses?
  Yes, but on a different page such as dashboard.
- What do you mean by **"The project conversation history should changes in status."**? Do you mean the project show page should show its' status?
  - If so, then it is already done.
